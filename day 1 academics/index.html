            The United States Air Force (USAF) is the air service branch of the 
            United States Armed Forces. It is one of the eight U.S. uniformed services. 
            Initially formed as a part of the United States Army on 1 August 1907, the 
            USAF was established as a separate branch of the U.S. Armed Forces on 18 
            September 1947 with the passing of the National Security Act of 1947. It is 
            the second youngest branch of the U.S. Armed Forces[a] and the fourth in order 
            of precedence. The U.S. Air Force articulates its core missions as air 
            superiority, global integrated intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, 
            rapid global mobility, global strike, and command and control.
